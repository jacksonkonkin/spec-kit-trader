# Feature Specification: Stock Trading Learning Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-you`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need you to create or summarize a bunch of specifications for a trading app a stock trading app that I'm building. Basically I just need to give a description of the features that I want this application to be built on in the technology stack I guess and then you can just summarize it very concisely and exactly what I need so the stock trading app. It should be a react. Front end connected to a super base SUPAVASE super bass. It's a database that basically post and authentication needs to be set up as well as deployed on Ver. I don't know if we need docker, but maybe we do. I'm not sure what else the user should be able to login and get verified through the super base authentication system and users should be able to basically every creation a new account and get 100,000 fake doland can buy stock in any one company they choose on the Toronto stock exchange so we need to find an API that we can grab data live from the Toronto stock exchange and then basically watch how other it's supposed to be like for a learning experience in a class so like let's say 30 people can all see the different stocks they picked and how they perform against each otherover the semester with just one investment at the front"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student in a finance/investment class, I want to practice stock trading with virtual money alongside my classmates, so I can learn investment strategies without financial risk and compare my performance with peers over a semester.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new student joins the class, **When** they create an account, **Then** they receive $100,000 in virtual currency to invest
2. **Given** a student has virtual funds, **When** they select a stock from the Toronto Stock Exchange, **Then** they can purchase shares at current market price using all their funds in a single transaction
3. **Given** multiple students have made investments, **When** any student views the leaderboard, **Then** they see all classmates' stock picks and current portfolio performance ranked by return percentage
4. **Given** a student has invested in a stock, **When** they check their portfolio, **Then** they see real-time value based on current TSX prices
5. **Given** the semester progresses, **When** students compare portfolios, **Then** they can see historical performance trends over the entire semester period

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: TSX market is closed - do we show last closing price or wait for market open]? Just show its closed witht he closing pricec
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: stock delisting or trading halts during the semester]? SKIP
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: a student wants to change their investment - is this allowed or is it truly one-time only]? Not allowed to change
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: students joining the class mid-semester]? They can buy in with $100,000 at the current market price

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow students to create individual accounts for the learning platform
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide each new student account with exactly $100,000 in virtual currency upon registration

- **FR-004**: Students MUST be able to make exactly one stock purchase using their entire virtual balance
- **FR-005**: System MUST display real-time stock prices from the Toronto Stock Exchange
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate and display each student's portfolio value based on current stock prices
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a leaderboard showing all students' stock selections and performance metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST track portfolio performance over the entire semester duration
- **FR-009**: Students MUST be able to view their own and other students' investment choices and returns
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact number of concurrent users - stated "30 people" but is this the limit or example]?
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users through [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific authentication requirements - email/password, school SSO, etc.]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain portfolio history for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long after semester ends]?
